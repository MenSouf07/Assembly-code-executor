Different files:

- identite.txt: reads a number and displays the same.
- double.txt: reads a number and displays the double
- random.txt: displays a random number between 0 and 1.
- displays.txt: reads a number N and displays all integers between 1 and N.
- opK.txt: K is a number between 0 and 15. Reads two values and returns a value that was calculated by doing the K operation as described in the statement.

For identite.txt (respectively random.txt), the interest is to check that the dup keyword (respectively rnd) works well. The same goes for opK.txt files.
